		By now I’m sure you’ve gathered that I’m a creative designer, an avid blogger and that I’m generally crazy about pretty colours and shapes. If you want to know more, grab a warm drink, light the fire and cuddle under a soft blanket while I condense my life story into a few paragraphs.

	Hello I am Terrence! and I am a Inspiring Fullstack Developer that can work in the Front end and Back end Technologies, I dont really have an Job in coding.

But a Little backround about My self I work at Wendys and Learn coding from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp looking for an clown shift.

Ever since i was young, I alway love computers and software

Went to school for eletric enginerring but math was my biggest downfall.

so i change my major from Phychology with pretty much stupid

Switch again to Game Programming and feel in love with the classs aspect for Computer science

didnt really teach you as much coding? No i didnt teach me nothing about coding at all.

So i started coding on my own which was so difficult, i havent been so much bored in my life.

I receive an text from my friend about coding school or Bootcamps

which i knew my Journey is about to unfold of doing that stuff i love about coding

But now i am seeking for Jobs and Potential Clients and Recruiter need for there team.
